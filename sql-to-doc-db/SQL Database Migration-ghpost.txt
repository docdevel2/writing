## Abstract
In this article, I show you how I used a Python application programming interface (API) to migrate my music library from a SQL relational database to a NoSQL document database. Using the Python X DevAPI in the MySQL Shell application, I highlight some basics about document databases, the Python methods used, and the database tool that enables migration. Readers who should get the most out of this article are those that have some basic familiarity with the structured query language (SQL) and with the Python programming language.

Keywords: MySQL, X DevAPI, Python, SQL, NoSQL, database
