Description/Abstract  
Since the turn of this millennium, there are a few significant advances in database architecture that have changed the database landscape. From these architectural advances, column-store database management systems (DBMS) have emerged. Column-store DBMSs have enabled the rapid growth in data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. This article discusses highlights of three particular architectural advances and challenges that they address.

Description/Abstract  
Data analytics applications require databases that can reach sizes in the terabyte to petabyte ranges, thus the need for speed and capacity. Today's column-store database architectures are designed to address these needs. They depart from traditional row-store database architectures. Column-store database systems employ advanced architectural techniques that leverage faster **CPUs**, large fast **cache** memory, and higher capacity disks to accelerate query execution. This article reveals some of these architectural techniques and how they evolved.
